# Ants
ants it is likely with you see them

every day whether on a hike in your

backyard or your kitchen you see them

running around seemingly chaotic you

have to manage to create impressive

structures file and transfer food and

generally react to the environment and

get the job done without any planning or

leaders but how in secret is collective

behavior toxin behavior is one group

outcomes arise from the aggregated

response of many individuals there are

three main parts that make up collective

behavior context the environmental

factors that affect the group in an ant

colony

it could be weather or new food source

process the algorithm of behavior that

does not have any great intention

it is simply programmed into the ants

genome and the outcome the behavior of

the whole group it is basically the

overall result of algorithms and

interactions between ends in other words

different events triggered certain types

of behaviors and every individual in the

group which make up the overall behavior

of a group it's like election of a

popular vote every vote counts different

people also vote for different things

based on the situation or the context

and the outcome is the action or the

change based on the results besides

instant understanding with the overall

goal of the vote is acting solely upon

different if-then algorithms to

understand the collective behavior of a

colony

what's looking at individual ant and

what it can do well most ants are

capable of detecting motion sensing

objects like food and water as well as

distinguish between the ants in their

colonies in foreign hands using their

antennae and also can determine what

other calling members are doing by

analyzing the hydrocarbon profile or the

other hands with their antennae and how

many individuals are doing a certain

test let's look at how ants forage for

food when in forging an finds a

bachelors to food it creates your

recruitment trail back to the nest

more for just use the pheromone trail to

get the food and bring it back to the

nest answer the same colony interact

with each other every time they meet so

if an ant gets enough interactions with

the ants that bring food to the colony

it becomes a forager

when an eye comes back with food it

stays in the entrance of the nest and if

ants that are coming later have food too

it lives in nests to get the foot again

but what if the researchers are

scattered randomly in the area I rate of

interactions makes the ants make sharp

turns covering the area more efficiently

when there is a big searching area and

travel in straight lines to cover more

ground and be more efficient Collective

behavior is actually common in biology

and complex systems for instance many

species of bacteria is collective

behavior to cooperate for example

bioluminescent bacteria in the ocean

uses chemicals to communicate and only

turn the lights on when there's a

certain number of bacteria present

I'm decentralized systems in human

society are often not much different

from ant colonies therefore we can make

computer simulations of systems that

have all collective behavior to solve

problems reducing traffic is one of them

cars and traffic are much like ants the

making computer simulations of traffic

at specific place we can determine what

the problem is and resolve it by

changing the context like adding an

extra light or a stop sign changing the

context and looking at the outcome of

the simulation will find a solution but

what about changing the algorithm cell

driving cars could almost completely get

rid of traffic but implementing

collective behavior communicating with

each other driving at the same speed and

not being selfish much like hands
